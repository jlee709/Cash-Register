// logic of the cash register

// main points 

// 1. ( display ) is the primary ui that prints all results

// 2. [clear] will clear the display

// 3. [get balance] will display the current balance

// 4. [deposit cash] will add the amount currently in the ( display ) to the cash register, then clears the display

// 5. [withdraw cash] will remove the amount currently in the ( display ) to the cash register, then clears the display


// First set up design layout



// have acsess to data in the html files via the dom

// use the DOM to get acsess to each key 

//apply the calculator function from cal file to the cash register logic


// $$ Check to see that onClick value is taken and can be passed into
// $$ the input field for the operations !!! make cash register work
// $$ with basic integers first then refactor for floats
// * parse ints, join method and for each loops and arrays is a way to use *
